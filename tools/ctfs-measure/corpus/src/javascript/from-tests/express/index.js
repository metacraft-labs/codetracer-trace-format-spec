/**
 * Drive a recorded Express session (RS-M9) — shared by the tests and the demo.
 *
 * Everything here is real: a real Express app on a real `http.Server` bound to
 * loopback, real HTTP over TCP, a real `.ct` container whose span stream is
 * decoded by the canonical Nim span reader.  Nothing is stubbed.
 *
 * The driver lives in the same process as the server on purpose.  Node is
 * single-threaded, so "the client and the server share one event loop" is not
 * a simplification of the deployment model — it is the same event loop a
 * production Node server multiplexes its own concurrent requests on, and it is
 * exactly the thing this milestone has to get right.  Running the driver
 * out-of-process would need a port file, a signal, and a graceful-shutdown
 * dance, and would test less.
 *
 * Run it under the recorder:
 *
 *     codetracer-js-recorder record test-programs/web/express -o /tmp/ct-js
 *
 * Environment:
 *
 *   CT_EXPRESS_REQUESTS    JSON `[[method, path, body|null], ...]` schedule.
 *                          Defaults to `DEMO_REQUESTS` below.
 *   CT_EXPRESS_CONCURRENT  "1" fires the whole schedule at once, so the
 *                          handlers interleave on the event loop.  Anything
 *                          else (the default) awaits each response before
 *                          issuing the next.
